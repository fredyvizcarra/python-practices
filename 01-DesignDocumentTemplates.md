# Design Document

## 1. Considerations

#### 1.1 Assumptions

_The development is carried out on a macOs system, using Visuak Studio Code como text editor. It is assumed the user has basic knowledge of python and terminal operation. The user will provide valid input after receiving error messages._

#### 1.2 Constraints

_The user interaction is limited to the command line, without graphical user interface._

#### 1.3 System Environment

_macOS, Visual Studio Code and Python._

## 2. Architecture

#### 2.1 Overview

_This Python script is designed to calculate compound interest based on user input. The architecture of the software is linear and procedural. The main flow of the program prompts the user to enter three pieces of information: the principal amount, the annual interest rate, and the number of years. It uses these inputs to calculate the future amount using the compound interest formula and then displays the result to the user._

#### 2.2 Component Diagrams

_The script is a simple program without a complex division into components or modules, no component diagrams are required in this case._

#### 2.3 Class Diagrams

_The program does not use custom classes, as it is based on functions_

#### 2.4 Sequence Diagrams

_Provide here any sequence diagrams. If possible list the use case they contribute to or solve. Provide descriptions if possible._

#### 2.5 Deployment Diagrams

_The script runs in a local environment, without the need for a server environment or external dependencies._

#### 2.6 Other Diagrams

_None._

## 3 User Interface Design

_Command Line Interface (CLI)._
